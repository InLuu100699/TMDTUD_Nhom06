long long ago there lived in a certain

village a rich merchant called Richard

he had fields and he sold grain and

vegetables so good was his business that

he was a millionaire one would think

that he lived a lavish luxurious life

but Richard was a miser and how dad my

shoes are all worn out I need new ones

we just bought them two years ago do you

want to make a pauper out of me dad my

feet are growing let's see how much

these shoes hurt me now only no shoe is

hurt which means you have not worn these

enough and they are still new next pick

this bring an ointment for your feet the

ointment costs half a Duquette shoes

will cost thirty now go everybody is

after my money

that was Richard who would not spend a

dime on anything while his treasure room

was full of gold and pearls and diamonds

his shoes were worn his family's clothes

were patched up and he allowed his

family and servants to eat just two

meals a day one day Richard was walking

in the market making his servants carry

sack full of grain he would not hire a

cart for them he passed by a bakery the

Baker had just finished baking a huge

fresh chocolate cake

the delicious aroma of the cake wafted

out to Richard and he felt such a

longing as he had never felt before to

taste that gorgeous cake you are back

yes what's wrong nothing

are you unwell no I want to take fresh

warm gooey luscious chocolate cake mmm

sounds delicious

wait I shall make not one but ten cakes

for us and all our servants and workers

what that is why I was saying nothing

you want to make a pauper out of me fine

let me bake just one cake for you me and

the children why should the children I

mean it will spoil their teeth fine I

shall bake a small cake for just the

both of us

you won't take - I don't believe you

Richard fine I shall pick just one

cupcake for you will that save your

mighty treasure hmm make it fast

I'm dying to have a bite so Richard's

wife baked one little chocolate cupcake

it was luscious and gooey and warm and

fresh and full of chocolate Richard took

one bite after another then licked his

fingers and even licked the plate but

not one crumb did he give his wife now

it so happened that a passing angel had

seen all of this

and he was annoyed juh blessed wealthy

man and so miserly

so mean instead of sharing his bounty

with the world he does not even let his

family enjoy it he deserves to be taught

a lesson a good one so the angel waited

till the next morning when Richard

walked out to work

then he took Richards form and came to

his house calling all the servants all

of you come here

yes sir I just met an angel who advised

me to share my wealth with everyone he

told me if I don't I shall die tonight

so go into the village and tell everyone

that my treasure room will be open today

anyone can come and take whatever they

want go

now and yes if anyone even if I try to

stop you beat me with a stick and drive

me away for remember if I do not share

my wealth I shall die as you wish sir so

the servants went out into the village

delivering their master's message soon

the entire village crowded in Richards

house and took two diamonds gold monies

from the Treasury at noon when Richard

came home for lunch he got the shock of

his life

hey here you get out of my treasure room

servants drive them away thieves come

back he is driving people away and we

must beat him with a stick

how can we do that he is our master

don't you remember what he had said this

morning we must beat him and drive him

away and so poor Richard was chased out

of his own house

by his own servants and driven away he

went to the court of the King and

related his tale the whole village was

stealing from me your highness but you

yourself had asked them to come and

share your will there are eyewitnesses

of that I have been at work all morning

sire are you the real Richard oh he he

is a fraud a cheat it is impossible to

make out the difference hmm but if I

were to choose why would I not believe a

man who shares his wealth over one who

is such a miser that his own family

stars your highness are you gonna put me

in jail maybe your highness don't he is

saying the truth he is the real Richard

I am an angel and I did this only to

teach him a lesson

arrest him your highness he tried to

take my wealth your highness as is what

his wealth belongs to me too and I agree

that my husband is indeed a terrible

miser the kind angel has done nothing

wrong in trying to punish him

you see that Richard of what juice is

holding on to wealth when people who are

the closest to you are so annoyed so

hurt by your miser leanness you have no

friends and your family too will not

consider it unjust if I send you to jail

is that the kind of life you want no

your highness I am sorry I realize my

folly now very well I give you one last

chance to mend your ways thank you your

highness

a celebration for my husband mend in his

waves I announce a banquet for everyone

in our village all right fine
